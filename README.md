## Repository Structure

The problems are organized by difficulty level to help guide your learning path:

- **easy**  
  Basic algorithms with low complexity, perfect for beginners to build foundational skills.

- **mid-level**  
  More challenging problems requiring greater abstraction and algorithmic thinking.

- **hardcore**  
  Advanced exercises that demand creative, optimized, and often non-trivial solutions.
